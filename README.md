# Beautiful web type

There are currently 404 typefaces in the Google web fonts directory. Many of them are awful. But there are also high-quality typefaces that deserve a closer look. Here are examples of these typefaces in action.

Start the Jekyll server and watch the Sass files with:

    rake server
