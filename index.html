      <h1><span>On the<br></span> Genealogy <span class="nudge">of</span> Morals</h1>
      <h2><span>Friedrich Nietzsche</span></h2>
      <section class="inner-text">
        <p>At this point I can no longer avoid giving a first, provisional statement of my own hypothesis concerning the origin of the &#8220;bad conscience&#8221;: it may sound rather strange and needs to be pondered, lived with, and slept on for a long time. I regard the bad conscience as the serious illness that man was bound to contract under the stress of the most fundamental change he ever experienced—that change which occurred when he found himself finally enclosed within the walls of society and of peace. The situation that faced sea animals when they were compelled to become land animals or perish was the same as that which faced these semi-animals, well adapted to the wilderness, to war, to prowling, to adventure: suddenly all their instincts were disvalued and &#8220;suspended.&#8221; From now on they had to walk on their feet and &#8220;bear themselves&#8221; whereas hitherto they had been borne by the water: a dreadful heaviness lay upon them. They felt unable to cope with the simplest undertakings; in this new world they no longer possessed their former guides, their regulating, unconscious and infallible drives: they were reduced to thinking, inferring, reckoning, coordinating cause and effect, these unfortunate creatures; they were reduced to their &#8220;consciousness,&#8221; their weakest and most fallible organ! I believe there has never been such a feeling of misery on earth, such a leaden discomfort and at the same time the old instincts had not suddenly ceased to make their usual demands. Only it was hardly or rarely possible to humor them: as a rule they had to seek new and, as it were, subterranean gratifications.</p>

        <p>All instincts that do not discharge themselves outwardly turn inward—this is what I call the internalization of man: thus it was that man first developed what was later called his &#8220;soul.&#8221; The entire inner world, originally as thin as if it were stretched between two membranes, expanded and extended itself, acquired depth, breadth, and height, in the same measure as outward discharge was inhibited. Those fearful bulwarks with which the political organization protected itself against the old instincts of freedom&#8212;punishments belong among these bulwarks&#8212;brought about that all those instincts of wild, free, prowling man turned backward against man himself. Hostility, cruelty, joy in persecuting, in attacking, in change, in destruction—all this turned against the possessors of such instincts: that is the origin of the &#8220;bad conscience.&#8221;</p>

        <p>The man who, from lack of external enemies and resistances and forcibly confined to the oppressive narrowness and punctiliousness of custom, impatiently lacerated, persecuted, gnawed at, assaulted, and maltreated himself; this animal that rubbed itself raw against the bars of its cage as one tried to &#8220;tame&#8221; it; this deprived creature, racked with homesickness for the wild, who had to turn himself into an adventure, a torture chamber, an uncertain and dangerous wilderness&#8212;this fool, this yearning and desperate prisoner became the inventor of the &#8220;bad conscience.&#8221; But thus began the gravest and uncanniest illness, from which humanity has not yet recovered, man&#8217;s suffering of man, of himself&#8212;the result of a forcible sundering from his animal past, as it were a leap and plunge into new surroundings and conditions of existence, a declaration of war against the old instincts upon which his strength, joy, and terribleness had rested hitherto.</p>

      <h1>Catullus 101</h1>
      <p class="poem">Many the peoples many the oceans I crossed &ndash;<br>
      I arrive at these poor, brother, burials<br>
      so I could give you the last gift owed to death<br>
      and talk (why?) with mute ash.<br>
      Now that Fortune tore you from me, you<br>
      oh poor (wrongly) brother (wrongly) taken from me,<br>
      now still anyway this &ndash; what a distant mood of parents<br>
      handed down as the sad gift for burials &ndash;<br>
      accept! soaked with tears of a brother<br>
      and into forever, brother, farewell and farewell.</p>
