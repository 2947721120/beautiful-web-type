        <p>There are currently 404 typefaces in the Google web fonts directory. Many of them are awful. But there are also high-quality typefaces that 
        deserve a closer look. Below are examples of these typefaces in action. Click the examples to get the typeface from the Google web fonts directory.</p>

          <p>At this point I can no longer avoid giving a first, provisional statement of my own hypothesis concerning the origin of the &#8220;bad conscience&#8221;: it may sound rather strange and needs to be pondered, lived with, and slept on for a long time. I regard the bad conscience as the serious illness that man was bound to contract under the stress of the most fundamental change he ever experiencedâ€”that change which occurred when he found himself finally enclosed within the walls of society and of peace. The situation that faced sea animals when they were compelled to become land animals or perish was the same as that which faced these semi-animals, well adapted to the wilderness, to war, to prowling, to adventure: suddenly all their instincts were disvalued and &#8220;suspended.&#8221; From now on they had to walk on their feet and &#8220;bear themselves&#8221; whereas hitherto they had been borne by the water: a dreadful heaviness lay upon them. They felt unable to cope with the simplest undertakings; in this new world they no longer possessed their former guides, their regulating, unconscious and infallible drives: they were reduced to thinking, inferring, reckoning, coordinating cause and effect, these unfortunate creatures; they were reduced to their &#8220;consciousness,&#8221; their weakest and most fallible organ! I believe there has never been such a feeling of misery on earth, such a leaden discomfort and at the same time the old instincts had not suddenly ceased to make their usual demands. Only it was hardly or rarely possible to humor them: as a rule they had to seek new and, as it were, subterranean gratifications.</p>
