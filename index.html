      <h1>Catullus 101</h1>
      <p class="poem">Many the peoples many the oceans I crossed &ndash;<br>
      I arrive at these poor, brother, burials<br>
      so I could give you the last gift owed to death<br>
      and talk (why?) with mute ash.<br>
      Now that Fortune tore you from me, you<br>
      oh poor (wrongly) brother (wrongly) taken from me,<br>
      now still anyway this &ndash; what a distant mood of parents<br>
      handed down as the sad gift for burials &ndash;<br>
      accept! soaked with tears of a brother<br>
      and into forever, brother, farewell and farewell.</p>
