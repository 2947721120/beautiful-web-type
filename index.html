      <h1>The New Wave of <br>Experience Design</h1>
      <blockquote>
        Phenomenology is the study of structures of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view. The central structure of an experience is its intentionality, its being directed toward something, as it is an experience of or about some object. </blockquote>

<p>
How shall we study conscious experience? We reflect on various types
of experiences just as we experience them. That is to say, we proceed
from the first-person point of view. However, we do not normally
characterize an experience at the time we are performing it. In many
cases we do not have that capability: a state of intense anger or fear,
for example, consumes all of one's psychic focus at the time. Rather,
we acquire a background of having lived through a given type of
experience, and we look to our familiarity with that type of
experience: hearing a song, seeing a sunset, thinking about love,
intending to jump a hurdle. The practice of phenomenology assumes such
familiarity with the type of experiences to be characterized.
Importantly, also, it is types of experience that phenomenology
pursues, rather than a particular fleeting experience — unless
its type is what interests us. &mdash;<em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em></p>

        <p>At this point I can no longer avoid giving a first, provisional statement of my own hypothesis concerning the origin of the &#8220;bad conscience&#8221;: it may sound rather strange and needs to be pondered, lived with, and slept on for a long time. I regard the bad conscience as the serious illness that man was bound to contract under the stress of the most fundamental change he ever experienced—that change which occurred when he found himself finally enclosed within the walls of society and of peace. The situation that faced sea animals when they were compelled to become land animals or perish was the same as that which faced these semi-animals, well adapted to the wilderness, to war, to prowling, to adventure: suddenly all their instincts were disvalued and &#8220;suspended.&#8221; From now on they had to walk on their feet and &#8220;bear themselves&#8221; whereas hitherto they had been borne by the water: a dreadful heaviness lay upon them. They felt unable to cope with the simplest undertakings; in this new world they no longer possessed their former guides, their regulating, unconscious and infallible drives: they were reduced to thinking, inferring, reckoning, coordinating cause and effect, these unfortunate creatures; they were reduced to their &#8220;consciousness,&#8221; their weakest and most fallible organ! I believe there has never been such a feeling of misery on earth, such a leaden discomfort and at the same time the old instincts had not suddenly ceased to make their usual demands. Only it was hardly or rarely possible to humor them: as a rule they had to seek new and, as it were, subterranean gratifications.</p>
